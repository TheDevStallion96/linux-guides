# Upgrading Ubuntu 16.04 to 20.04 via Terminal
To upgrade Ubuntu 16.04 to 20.04 using the terminal, you can follow these steps:

1. **Backup Important Data**: Before proceeding with any major system upgrade, it's crucial to back up your important data to ensure it's safe.

2. **Update Existing Packages**: First, make sure your current Ubuntu 16.04 installation is up to date by running:

   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

3. **Install the Update Manager**: If it's not already installed, you might need to install the `update-manager-core` package. You can do this with:

   ```
   sudo apt install update-manager-core
   ```

4. **Edit the Release Upgrades File**: Open the release upgrade configuration file for editing:

   ```
   sudo nano /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades
   ```

   Ensure that the file contains the following line, set to "normal":

   ```
   Prompt=normal
   ```

   If it's set to "lts," change it to "normal" to allow upgrading to non-LTS releases.

5. **Start the Upgrade**: Run the following command to start the upgrade process:

   ```
   sudo do-release-upgrade
   ```

   This command will initiate the upgrade process to Ubuntu 18.04 first, and then to Ubuntu 20.04. Follow the on-screen instructions. During the upgrade, you will be prompted to confirm various actions. Be sure to read and confirm as necessary.

6. **Post-Upgrade Cleanup**: After the upgrade is complete, it's a good idea to run the following commands to remove any unused packages and perform some cleanup:

   ```
   sudo apt autoremove
   sudo apt clean
   ```

7. **Reboot**: Finally, it's recommended to reboot your system to ensure that you're running the new Ubuntu 20.04 kernel and services:

   ```
   sudo reboot
   ```

Your system should now be running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Verify the version by running:

```
lsb_release -a
```

Please note that upgrading your system can take some time, and it's crucial to back up your data and ensure you have a stable internet connection during the process. Also, be prepared for potential issues, so it's a good idea to have a backup of your data before proceeding.
